# Introduction
This program combines a simple Web Crawler and Scraper to extract data for Recipes from various sites. The Web
crawler starts with a base URL for the domain, and will crawl the site looking for individual recipes, extract the
data about these and persist them (this component not added yet).

# Functionality to be finished
    -Convert to Test-Driven codebase
    -Write the Web Crawler component
    -Add some kind of persistence provision; to file, database etc.

Components:

    ./crawler/  Code for the Web Crawler components

    ./scraper/  Code for the page/data scraper components

    ./miscellany/   miscellaneous other bits and pieces such as configuration files and example documents/data etc.
